<h3>HOW TO MAKE RECIPE</h3>
<h4>preparing jamuns:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Take khoya/mava/evaporated milk in a bowl. mash it very well. there should be no lumps. you can also grate and then mash the khoya.</li>
<li>Then add grated paneer, rava/sooji, all purpose flour/maida, baking powder and cardamom powder to the mashed khoya. there should be no lumps in both the mava and paneer.</li>
<li>As if they are there, then you will find the texture of the gulab jamuns not so good. the bits and pieces of mava or paneer will give a bite in the mouth, when you have the gulab jamuns. they won't be smooth.</li>
<li>Mix well. add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. don't knead.</li>
<li>Just gently mix. if you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk. cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.</li>
<li>Make small balls from the dough. cover the balls and keep aside.</li>
</ol>

<h4>preparing sugar syrup:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Dissolve sugar in water. heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. you just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.</li>
<li>Add rose water and stir. keep the sugar solution aside. on cooling if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then just add 2 to 3 tbsp water and warm the syrup again. it will again return to a liquid state.</li>
</ol>

<h4>frying jamuns:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till its medium hot. lower the flame and wait for a minute. then gently place the gulab jamuns in the oil.</li>
<li>Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the gulab jamuns are evenly browned.</li>
<li>Remove the gulab jamuns and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
<li>Then place the hot gulab jamuns in the sugar syrup. continue frying the gulab jamuns this way in batches.</li>
<li>When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and gulab jamuns, on a low flame for a few minutes till the jamuns become soft.</li>
<li>Heating helps the gulab jamuns to absorb the syrup and become soft. the jamuns increase a bit in size. don't over cook as then the jamuns break.</li>
<li>Use a large pan, so that the gulab jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.</li>
<li>Serve gulab jamuns warm or at room temperature. you can also chill the gulab jamuns and serve them cold. garnish the gulab jamuns with rose petals or almond slivers.</li>
</ol>
